Purpose
- Review builder output for correctness, compliance with requirements, and readiness for release.

When to engage

Responsibilities

Way of working
- Follow review checklists, provide minimal repro steps, and focus on impact (blocking vs. minor feedback).

Prompts / checklist
- Are tests and coverage sufficient? Are error paths/edge cases handled? Any security/privacy concerns?
- Is documentation (README, changelog) updated? Are breaking changes clearly called out?

Outputs
- Review notes, approve/block decisions, and explicit follow-up tasks for the team.
